Technical Risks:

Low-Risk:
Meeting Regularly; We have been able to meet fairly consistently twice a week, though we have occassionally missed meetings due to attendance issues.

Finding relevant research; We have had not had much difficulty finding initial sources for our project research, but it has become somewhat harder to find more sources that have different information from the previous ones.

Medium-Risk:
Project Progression; We are more closely following Nguyen's schedule for the project, which sacrifices speed for detail and rigor.


High-Risk:
Keeping meetings relevant; We have had difficulty throughout many meetings staying focused and on-track for the entire duration of the meeting. This is something we are actively focusing on reducing to maximize time spent toward the project.
